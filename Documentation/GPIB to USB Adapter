There are many instruments that we have interest in connecting to for PTCS. Some of these have a GPIB port in addition to other methods of connecting, and some only have a GPIB port.
We decided to purchase the GPIB to USB adapter.

[Read the manual](http://prologix.biz/downloads/PrologixGpibUsbManual-6.0.pdf)
Everything below highlights key points of the manual that are useful to us
After you have a USB-B to USB-A converter cable, you can plug the adapter into the computer. If the adapter has never connected to the computer before, it will probably download drivers silently in the background

Find and connect to that port using PyVisa and try to send commands to the adapter to query and change its settings so you know it works

Now a device can be connected to the instrument. In Devices.json, the device should have the same COM port as the GPIB to USB adapter has

Things to do when you start communicating with an instrument:
-   Make sure the adapter is in controller mode
-	Set the GPIB address to the desired one in order to connect with the instrument desired
-   Make sure messages returned from the instrument connected do not have extra \r\n characters on them. If so, comparing the result to "1" for example will work as expected.
-   Make sure to use the built in write and query methods to communicate with the instrument correctly through the GPIB to USB adapter. These methods make sure the GPIB address of the adapter is the same as that of the class calling the methods and that the adapter either does or does not expect a return message automatically from the instrument
