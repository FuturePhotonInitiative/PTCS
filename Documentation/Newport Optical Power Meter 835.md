So, this instrument has an older computer interface but it still works. The only output port on the instrument is a GPIB port. it comes with a cable, but not many computers produced now adays accept GPIB. We bought a GPIB to USB adapter that we stuck on the instrument which then we were able to successfully interface with it. The only trick is that it has its own specific commands that you can set that sometimes get in the way of interracting with the instrument, but there is a manual in the [Data Sheets](\\hawk\RIDL\internal\projects\EVT\internal documents\ProberControl Documentation\ProberControl-Summer2019) folder that will help with understanding it.
