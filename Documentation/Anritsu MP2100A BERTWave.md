This instrument is capable of producing eyescans and calculating an error rate based on the insertion of bit errors. This can do electrical as well as use an optical transceiver. Currently we dot not have working cabling to test an optical transceiver with the instrument because Dr Prebble thinks the cables we were trying to use are broken. An eyescan is able to be done from an electrical signal though. This can be done by running a line from the **Sync Out** to the **Trigger Clock in** and also running a line from the PPG1 **Data Out** to the ED1 **Data In(A In)**.

Connecting remotely can be done in many ways. Dr Patru desired it to be connected over a network through ethernet. It is not determined if the instrument needs to be connected to the network in order for other computers on the network to connect to it, but it is on the network now with the name of **anritsu-mp2100a-1.cfd.rit.edu**. Because of dynamic ip addresses, the address for the instrument may change depending on other computers on the network. Before running a test remotely on the instrument, make sure the ip address for the instrument in Devices.json is the same one that shows up under the ethernet port 1 ip address on the **ipconfig** command dont forget to connect an ethernet cable).
