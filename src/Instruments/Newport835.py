    things happen with the fact that the GPIB to USB converter has a read-after-write setting that does not always
    work well with device.read and device.query

    Dont forget that if the attenuator cap is screwed on the detector, you should run the command
    to let the instrument know that it is on. This is not the default when turned on.
